# chat-ws-redis-mongo
To run de project is so easy.

1. run `docker-compose up -d`. This allows us to run all the necesary docker instances that manage redis and mongo.
2. run `npm start dev` or `node app.js`
3. watch how the magic is happening in the `.html` files in ./client directory.

Enjoy it and modify it as you wish.
